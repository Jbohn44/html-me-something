				<h1>Childhood Memories With The NES</h1>

				<p class="text">One of my earliest memories is of being at my cousin&apos;s house and playing Nintendo.  I can&apos;t recall just how
				   old I was at the time but I must have been four or five.  We played Super Mario Bros and I remember being dazzled by
				   the sounds, colors, the movement, and excitement of the game.  Of course at that age I couldn't analyze those feelings
				   but all I knew is that I really had to have an NES.  When it was time to go for the evening I remember crying
				   and throwing a fit because I wanted to play more Nintendo (not my finest moment).  It would be some time after that
				   before I could enjoy a NES of my own but in the meantime my parents bought my brother and I a...</p>

			<h2>Enter The Sega Master System</h2>

			<p class="text">So my parents ended up getting my brother and I a Sega Master System.  For those unfamiliar, it was an 8-bit system developed by Sega
			   that preceded the Sega Genesis.  It was a fine console and my brother and I had fun with it.  I remember playing 
		       the first Y&apos;s game.  It was cool and mystifying but I didn&apos;t understand how rpgs worked at that young age(also, Y&apos;s 
		       had a peculiar combat system).  I never got very far.  Even though I had fun with Master System, I still
		       envied everyone that had a Nintendo.  Today, however, I wish I still had my original console.</p>

			<h2>My Gaming Glory Days</h2>
			<p class="text">I remember the day my mother bought me an NES.  She sold the Sega Master System
			   and used the money to buy a used NES from a neighbor.  I remember being excited
		       that I finally had a Nintendo of my own.  It came with several games of which I 
		       only remember <i>Double Dragon</i>.</p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon_(video_game)#/media/File:Double_Dragon_NES_Screenshot.png"><img src="images/Double_Dragon_NES_Screenshot.png" class="solidbordered" alt="Double Dragon NES screen shot"></a>
		
			<p class="text">Over the next couple years, I would get NES games for Christmas or birthdays and I started to amass a collection.  I didn&apos;t have
			   <i>that</i> many games but I had enough.  Couple that with trips to the video rental store and I played quite a few
			   NES games as a kid(when I grew up and started using the internet I discoverd <b>TONS</b> of NES games I hadn&apos;t played).
			   My main gaming time came on Saturday mornings before and after Saturday morning cartoons.  I played many games such 
			   as <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>, <i>Ninja Gaiden II</i>, <i>Megaman II</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, and <i>Contra</i>
			   just to name a few.</p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(NES_video_game)#/media/File:Ninja_Gaiden_(NES).jpg"><img src="images/Ninja_Gaiden_(NES).jpg" class="solidbordered" alt="Ninja Gaiden NES boxart"></a>
			<p class="text">As awesome as playing nintendo was, I can&apos;t help but recall all the teeth clenching, rage inducing times I had with the NES.  
			   Playing NES games as an adult is hard enough, I don&apos;t know how I did it as a child(actually I do, but more on that a bit later).
			   The <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> series was probably one of the worst offenders.  I remember being absolutely defeated by that game,
			   probably to the point of tears.  I hate to admit it but throwing NES controllers wasn't unheard of for me
			   when I was a child.  In my early NES gaming days many games were played but not many games were completed.  I bet 
			   my mom noticed some of this behavior or maybe I straight told her that my games were too hard because not too long after
			   my 8th birthday I got a <i>Game Genie</i>!  That made my gaming life a lot easier as a child.</p>

			    <figcaption>This saved my sanity</figcaption>

			<p class="text">It is cheating but I believe it was the only way I could actually beat games back then.  It allowed me to play through
			   many of my favorite games with out breaking controllers!</p>
			<p class="text">I had a lot of fun with the NES and by 1992 or 1993 I had moved on to the SNES.  I still played NES games when I got newer consoles
			   and I still play them to this day.  I guess the NES holds a certain nostalgia for me that no
			   other console does.  These days I collect NES cartridges when I can find them for good prices
			   which as of late is few and far between.  The market for NES collecting has exploded in 
			   the last 10 years.  In the early 2000&apos;s, many NES cartridges were dirt cheap and I kick myself
			   for not buying them back then.  Oh Well!</p>
